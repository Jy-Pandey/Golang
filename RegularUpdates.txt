go get gorm.io/gorm
go get gorm.io/driver/postgres
go get go.uber.org/fx
go get go.uber.org/fx@latest
go get golang.org/x/crypto/sha3@latest
go mod tidy // Go fetch all required dependencies 

Fx : Automatic dependebcy injector

Day - 5
1. Learned how to build REST API using Gin framework (CRUD operations with PostgreSQL).
2. Understood Fx framework for Dependency Injection with a working example.
3. Understood Interfaces in Go ‚Äì how they work.
4. Started learning OpenAPI Specification ‚Äì how to document APIs using Swagger UI.

For integrating swagger UI
download -  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
Extract the ZIP file ‚Üí open the folder swagger-ui-master/dist
Copy the entire dist folder to your project inside static folder and rename it with swagger-ui
in index file - replace this url: "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json", 
with url: "/openapi.yaml",
Now it tells Swagger UI:
‚ÄúLoad the OpenAPI documentation from our own file at http://localhost:8080/openapi.yaml‚Äù

Day - 6
1. Learned how to write OpenAPI specification in YAML format to describe REST APIs properly.
2. Learned how to use Swagger UI to show and test API routes in the browser.
3. Created a Bookstore project with CRUD operations using Gin, PostgreSQL, and used Dependency Injection to organize the code better.

Day-7
1. Learned what goroutines are and how they help in concurrency and parallelism in Go.
2. Used sync package tools like WaitGroup, Mutex, and channels to manage multiple goroutines safely.
3. Learned about race conditions and how to stop them using Mutex.
4. Revised how JOIN works in PostgreSQL.
5. Started learning about project folder structure and its parts like configure, models, handlers, services, repository, and routes.

Day-8 BookApi - Third party Api 
1. Built a Book API using Go, Gin, and PostgreSQL with clean folder structure.
2. Used Fx to manage dependencies like database and routes easily.
3. Added trending books from an external API into our database.
4. Set up a cron job to clear all books from the table every hour.
5. Used Postman for testing and connected OpenAPI YAML to Swagger UI for documentation.

Day-9
1. Created a Student-Course project with proper folder structure and wrote OpenAPI spec.
2. Learned how to connect students and courses using a join table and used SQL joins to fetch enrolled course data.
3. Started learning authentication using JWT tokens and how to securely store passwords with bcrypt.

Day - 10

1. Created a project where users can sign up and log in using JWT tokens, and protected routes using authentication middleware.
2. Learned how to send JWT tokens in two ways: using Authorization headers and using cookies for browser-based apps.
3. Understood how middleware works to verify tokens and restrict access to authenticated users only.

BindJson() 
- Internally calls MustBindWith() which aborts the request and sends a 400 Bad Request if there's any error during binding.
- Use this when you want to automatically reject bad input.
if err := c.BindJSON(&myStruct); err != nil {
    // This line might not even run, because Gin already aborted the request
}

ShouldBindJson()
- Internally calls ShouldBindWith() and returns an error instead of aborting.
- You‚Äôre responsible for checking the error and deciding what to do.
- Use this when you want more control over error handling.
if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&myStruct); err != nil {
    c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
    return
}

# What is a Model?
A model is a Go struct that represents a table in the database.
Each field = column in SQL.


Day - 11
1. Learned about context.Context in Go ‚Äì how it's used for timeouts, cancellations.
2. Practiced writing raw SQL-like queries using GORM ‚Äì including filtering, joins, grouping, and using Scan() with custom structs.
3. Explored the Gin framework in detail ‚Äì learned how to use routes, groups, middleware, query parameters, and static file handling.
4. Learned how to upload media files (like images) to our local server using Gin's FormFile() and SaveUploadedFile() methods.
