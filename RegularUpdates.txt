6. Started using PostgreSQL for REST APIs in Go

go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get gorm.io/gorm
go get gorm.io/driver/postgres
go get go.uber.org/fx
go get go.uber.org/fx@latest
go get golang.org/x/crypto/sha3@latest
go mod tidy // Go fetch all required dependencies 

Fx : Automatic dependebcy injector

Day - 5
1. Learned how to build REST API using Gin framework (CRUD operations with PostgreSQL).
2. Understood Fx framework for Dependency Injection with a working example.
3. Understood Interfaces in Go – how they work.
4. Started learning OpenAPI Specification – how to document APIs using Swagger UI.

For integrating swagger UI
download -  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
Extract the ZIP file → open the folder swagger-ui-master/dist
Copy the entire dist folder to your project inside static folder and rename it with swagger-ui
in index file - replace this url: "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json", 
with url: "/openapi.yaml",
Now it tells Swagger UI:
“Load the OpenAPI documentation from our own file at http://localhost:8080/openapi.yaml”
